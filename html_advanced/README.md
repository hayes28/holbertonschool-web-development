### Tasks
0. README and objectives!
  In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

1. Header
  ##### Let’s start by the top: the header
![header1](https://github.com/hayes28/holbertonschool-web-development/assets/107968573/d73c73ae-8e5a-4014-a86d-f61dc754ce96)

##### Here the wireframe of it:

  + Create the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.)
  + In the body, add an header tag
  + Inside this header:
    - Add a link element with an image inside
    - Add a block of 3 link elements
 
2. Banner
##### Now, the banner under the header:
![Banner](https://github.com/hayes28/holbertonschool-web-development/assets/107968573/b0236d27-16e8-4e7e-8dbe-a39d27e158c7)

Under the header, add a main element with inside a section element.

##### In this section element, add:
  + A block with inside:
    - An heading tag (don’t forget to use the correct heading value)
    - A text element
    - A button tag
 
  + Another block with inside:
    - Another heading tag (same, be careful about which one you are using)
    - A block containing 4 blocks - each block with inside:
        - An image
        - An heading tag
        - A text

3. Quote
Under the banner, we will add the quote block:

##### The quote section is inside the main:

  + Create a new section for the quote
  + Inside, add a block containing:
    - An image
    - Another block with inside:
        - A quote tag
        - An author quote
        - A text

4. Videos
##### Let’s now add the videos list:
![video](https://github.com/hayes28/holbertonschool-web-development/assets/107968573/0f5bc979-7e69-4a0d-ba42-9d34467fd432)
##### New section with inside:

  + An heading tag
  + A block containing the 4 video block - each of them are composed with:
      - An image
      - An heading
      - A text
      - A block for the author:
          - A image
          - An heading
      - A block for the rating:
          - A block of images (one star = one image)
          - A text

5. Membership
##### Membership section is similar as the videos list:

![membership](https://github.com/hayes28/holbertonschool-web-development/assets/107968573/a5862be7-d24f-4153-ac87-4578934f7475)

##### After the videos list section, add a new section containing:

  + An heading
  + A block with inside 4 block item - each block defined with:
    - An image
    - An heading
    - A text
  + A button

6. FAQ
##### The FAQ section is ending the page before the footer:

##### Add a section for the FAQ with inside:

  + A block that contains 2 “row block”
  + Each “row block” contains 2 “item block”
  + Each “item block” is composed of:
    - An heading
    - A text

7. Footer
##### And… the footer!

![footer](https://github.com/hayes28/holbertonschool-web-development/assets/107968573/4e82eee9-5fdf-47d0-953a-6dc04b9e52e8)

##### After the last section, outside of the main, add a footer:

  + A global block (used later for centering the footer content), inside this block:
    - A “row block” with:
      - An image
      - A block with inside:
          Images with link
    - A text
And… that’s it for the moment - the result should not be shiny, don’t worry, CSS is coming…
